          Roronoa Zoro, also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro, is a main combatant
          of the Straw Hat Pirates, one of their two swordsmen, one of the
          Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, and is publicly
          recognized as the right-hand man of his crew's captain Monkey D.
          Luffy. Formerly a bounty hunter, he is the second member of Luffy's
          crew and the first to join it, doing so in the Romance Dawn Arc. Born
          in the East Blue, Zoro is the son of Tera and Roronoa Arashi, the
          grandson of Shimotsuki Furiko and Roronoa Pinzoro, and the grandnephew
          of Shimotsuki Ushimaru, making him a matrilineal descendant of both
          the Shimotsuki Family of Wano Country and the legendary samurai,
          Shimotsuki Ryuma. As a master of Three Sword Style, a swordsmanship
          style which he created during his childhood training in Shimotsuki
          Village, Zoro is one of the three most powerful combatants of the
          Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Sanji, who are referred to as the
          "Monster Trio". His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the
          world, in order to honor a promise he made to his deceased childhood
          friend Kuina.
